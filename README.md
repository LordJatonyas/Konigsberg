# Konigsberg
A 2D puzzle game inspired by Euler's "Seven Bridges of Königsberg" thought experiment.

## How To Play?
For a given playable level, your task is to cross every bridge just once. To prevent any confusion, I suggest going through the tutorial first before trying at the decks.
To run the game, download this [file](https://github.com/LordJatonyas/Konigsberg/blob/main/play/Konigsberg.zip) and double-click konigsberg.html. You should be playing the game on your web browser in no time. Have fun!
